# Slow-Fast-pytorch-implementation with Colab notebook
This is just a cleaned up and workable verison of the repo shared here https://github.com/MagicChuyi/SlowFast-Network-pytorch that was missing weights and . I intend to make some changes as I proceed. 

As mentioned in the original repo, this gives a real time activity detection by detecting using YOLOv3, tracking using DeepSORT and
activity detection using Slow Fast.
