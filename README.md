# Slow-Fast-pytorch-implementation with Colab notebook
This is just a cleaned up and workable verison of the repo shared here https://github.com/MagicChuyi/SlowFast-Network-pytorch that was missing weights and . I intend to make some changes as I proceed. 

As mentioned in the original repo, this gives a real time activity detection by detecting using YOLOv3, tracking using DeepSORT and
activity detection using Slow Fast.

# Run the demo on your own data

1.Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/vaib-saxena/Slow-Fast-pytorch-implementation.git

2.Download Yolo v3 weights: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1SSpVueL6W_4BE3sFDkzAgdMd35Mtl2N5/view?usp=sharing and paste in the directory

3.Download DeepSort re-id weights: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1bwLHXS5TocUfDL2-iLNJLs8WfUOZtg9B/view?usp=sharing and paste in deep\checkpoint directory

4.Download Pre-trained SlowFast Network weights: https://drive.google.com/open?id=1JSUyjywot81AdKx_JZwKCXH034170R55 and paste in the directory

5.Modify the weights path and your video path in video_demo.py.

6.Run video_demo.py.
